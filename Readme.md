# Lab Solutions
This repository has the solutions for the labs.

As there are multiple exercises, we chose to split them into multiple binaries. To flash and run them, run `cargo run --bin <name_of_binary>` (without the `.rs` extension).

**Note** Please open the whole workspace, not only a single solution (folder) separately.

To build the solutions, enter the requested lab
folder and run `cargo build` and `cargo run`.
